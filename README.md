A curated list of awesome ARCore projects and resources. Feel free to contribute! 谷歌ARCore开源项目及相关资源收集，一起来贡献资源！

ARCore is a software development kit developed by Google that allows for augmented reality applications to be built. This repo was inspired by [Awesome-ARKit](https://github.com/olucurious/Awesome-ARKit). I hope this repo can help people who love Google and want to learn more about ARCore.
